# RasPI-Weather-WebApp
A web-based, automatic and intelligent irrigation and measurement system for your garden.

The system periodically acquires measurements, saves them in a virtual MySQL database and displays the data on a website. A Python script aquires measurements, checks the soil humidity and switches a self-made irriation system on/off based on the received data.
